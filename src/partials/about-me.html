  <p>Hi, I’m Shelby! I currently live in Colorado, but my heart remains in Tucson, Arizona. Before I came to Tucson and fell in love with its mountains, yoga studios, and FOOD, I lived in Phoenix, the San Francisco Bay Area, Pittsburgh, Pasadena, and Arlington. Moving around so much has led me to develop a passion for traveling and new experiences. When I’m not daydreaming about my next meal, I’m cuddling my sweet dogs and stretching on my yoga mat. Often at the same time.</p>
  <p>I’ve loved to cook for as long as I can remember. I have my mom and grandmother, Nanny, to thank for teaching me how to cook and bake, and for being brave enough to try all of my early recipe creations. In 2006, when I was a freshman in high school, I developed a passion for making food that is both delicious and nutritious. I found myself watching The Food Network more than anything else and spent my weekends altering recipes to be healthier. Since then, I have learned a lot more about healthy eating and have used this knowledge to create recipes that are even more wholesome.</p>
  <p>In the Fall of 2013, I took an environmental ethics class. Although I had known about the harmful effects of industrial farming to some extent, this class opened my eyes to the pain that this industry brings to animals, humans, and our environment. As an assignment for the class, I completed a one week vegan challenge. I enjoyed it so much that I did it again a few weeks later. Since then, I have found myself eating a diet that is mostly free of animal products and have developed a passion for creating recipes without them.</p>
  <p>Whether or not you want to commit to a vegan diet, I believe that it is important to eat more plants and less meat for the sake of our bodies, animals, and the environment. I hope that you try my recipes, enjoy them, and realize that healthy food can be more wonderful than you ever thought possible! Thanks so much for stopping by!</p>
