I’m living in beautiful Colorado (I know, you feel really sorry for me), but I miss my family/dogs/desert sunsets and the general content that comes with knowing that you’re home. If the past six months have taught me anything, it’s that home is not just a structure with four walls and a roof that keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Home is the place my puppies are snoring on the couch, the place I feel like a contributing member of my community, and the place that makes me swell with pride every time I think about it. And I haven’t had a place to call home in six months.</p><p>I’ve always been able to find a little bit of home in the kitchen. The smell of onions and garlic bubbling on the stove will always remind me of the comfort of my Nanny’s house, and freshly baked banana bread never fails to bring me back to my mom’s kitchen. And so in this time of yearning I find myself in the kitchen more than ever, if only to awaken these fond memories of home.</p><p>Making (and subsequently eating) this buddha bowl was so therapeutic. Maybe it was all the carbs, or the creamy sauces, or the smell of herbs and garlic that rose from the oven. Maybe it was the tender sweet potato, the slightly crispy purple potatoes, or all of the vitamins in those leafy dark greens. Maybe it’s all of that comfort that puts the buddha in buddha bowl.</p>',

But, it’s a pretty shade of red and tastes considerably better than lipstick, so you really don’t have anything to worry about.</p><p>My acai bowl awakening came in the summer of 2013, when I took a trip to Maui, Hawaii. I loved snorkeling with sea turtles and watching purple-y orange sunsets, but I will never forget the raw vegan cafe, Choice, that I ate at almost every day. Before this trip, I thought that a raw vegan diet consisted of a bunch of carrots and cucumbers. Which are great, but…boring. Choice completely blew my mind. I ate raw vegan ravioli, raw vegan brownies, and raw vegan pizza. And then, on a beautiful warm morning, I tried one of the acai bowls at Choice. A mountainous, thick, deep purple smoothie was served in a bowl. A smoothie in a bowl! Topped with sliced strawberries, bananas, goji berries, shredded coconut, cacao nibs, and bee pollen, it remains the most glorious thing I have ever seen. And I’ve been to the Grand Canyon.</p><p>Needless to say, I was in deep withdrawal when I returned home to Arizona at the end of the trip. I scoured every smoothie shop around, but never found an acai bowl that compared to the one at Choice. So, I returned to the kitchen to create my own. I had some failures (I do not recommend putting dried figs on your acai bowl). But eventually, with the discovery of Sambazon Acai juice, I was able to create an incredible acai bowl at home.</p><p>This acai bowl isn’t just a weak substitute for the good stuff. It is the good stuff. It’s a rich, creamy smoothie bowl filled with frozen fruit, chia seeds, greens, and acai juice. It’s toppings such as sliced bananas, berries, nuts, coconut, and chocolate, but not dried figs. It’s breakfast. It’s lunch. It’s dessert. And best of all, it’s not ten dollars.</p>',

The first three ingredients for this recipe (flax egg+coconut oil+coconut sugar) create the most amazing, delicious, sticky, sweet gooey toffee when they are mixed together. Oh man.

I was initially attracted to eating mostly plant-based foods for both ethical and health reasons. Staying away from meat and other animal products allowed me to forget about where those products were coming from (and how those animals were treated) and make me feel as if I was contributing to the greater good by not supporting industrial factory farms with my money. Eating mostly plant-based meals still makes me feel the best. There’s nothing like the feeling of ending my day full of nutritious greens, legumes, whole grains, and fruit.</p><p>However, as I explored and learned more about my local food community over the past year, I found that many of my local ranchers and farmers are producing meat, cheese, and milk in a way that is healthy, humane, and sustainable. The ranches around me keep their cows, chickens, and and lambs on an expansive pasture, where they spend each day grazing on chemical-free grass. They are treated as any being should be: with kindness and respect. My local dairy farm knows that the key to their success is taking proper care of their cows, an ideal I align so closely with. They package their milk in glass bottles that can be refunded for $2, so that they can reuse them. And the beautiful ladies from my local goat cheese farm (goat cheese=life) have told me that their goats live more lavish lives than most people.</p><p>And so, while most of my farmer’s market money still ends up in the pockets of local, organic produce farmers, I feel happy to buy a log of goat cheese, a cut of grass-fed beef, and a gallon of whole milk whenever I want to. People aren’t going to stop eating meat or animal products. But, if given the chance to see the impact that supporting humane, local farms can have on animals, the environment, and their local communities, they might be persuaded to support these farms over companies such as Tyson, National Beef, and Cargill.</p><p>As I turn my focus to knowing where my food comes from and how it (and the people that produce it) is treated, you might see changes on The Sun and The Spoon. While I won’t be posting recipes for pot roast any time soon, I will be posting more seasonal recipes (and some might even have a little goat cheese thrown in). Part of my goal in doing this is to encourage others to seek out what their local farms have to offer. If you don’t live in Central or Southern Arizona, I would be happy to help you track down your own farmer’s market as well as your local goat farm.</p><p>So now that you known how much I love goat cheese (and the goats it comes from) I can profess my love for these super-duper Vegan Pumpkin Spice Snickerdoodles, which are by far the some of the best vegan cookies I’ve ever made. Why? Because not only are they wholesome Vegan Pumpkin Spice Snickerdoodles (100% whole wheat, coconut oil, PUMPKIN), they are soft, moist, sweet, straight up delicious cookies.</p><p>The biggest problem I’ve had developing vegan cookie recipes is getting the texture to be just right (a.k.a. not dense, not completely flat, not a rock hard ball of dried dough), but I think I’ve finally found the solution: almond milk (AND NO FLAX EGG). When I realized this, I was kind of mind-boggled. “No flax egg?!” I thought. It was an incredible realization for a girl who thought every vegan baked good needed an egg substitute. But anyways, it works. It creates the most perfect cookie dough that you just know is going to produce the best, most tender cookies once it’s been baked. YUM.</p><p>And guess what? I’ve come to realize that non-vegans need to bake vegan cookies once in awhile, too. Sometimes your friend’s vegan husband is coming over and you know how much he loves snickerdoodles, let alone pumpkin. Or your niece just had a baby who’s lactose intolerant and you want to send her some homemade cookies. Or you just want to prove to yourself that vegan cookies can taste as good as those ones your grandmas used to make. So pop a batch of these in the oven, because the dough literally takes 10 minutes to make, you only need one bowl, and everyone will love you even more than they already do.</p>',

          body: '<p>Do you have way too much zucchini overtaking your kitchen counters and refrigerator drawers? Maybe you were a little overzealous during the spring planting season, or maybe that 10lb basket of zucchini at the farmer’s market was just too pretty to pass up. Either way, you’re getting desperate and maybe even doing things like hiding those big green vegetables in…gasp…cookies! However delicious those zucchini cookies and cakes really are, my 10 year-old self is still mortified.</p><p>Luckily, I’ve come a long way since then. These days you don’t even have to “hide” zucchini in order for me to eat it. I love it sauteed, grilled, roasted, and even raw (zucchini noodles, anyone?). One of my favorite combinations has always been zucchini and pesto. Because zucchini is so mild, it allows the pesto to really shine. Put those two things over a bed of pasta and you have yourself a wonderful summer meal.</p><p>The pesto in this dish is a slightly different than your run of the mill pesto. It’s made up of quelites, a Mexican variety of spinach, toasted pecans, garlic, Parmigiano-Reggiano (or nutritional yeast), and, because I’m not entirely insane, basil. If you can’t get your hands on quelites, baby spinach is a wonderful substitution. This milder version of pesto creates balance between itself, the tender sweet zucchini ribbons, and the linguine. I can only hope that it serves in your quest to use up all of your summer squash!</p>',

The pesto should be mostly smooth but should still retain some texture from the pecans.</li><li>Add 1-tablespoon sea salt to the pot of boiling water.</li><li>Cook the Linguine according to package directions in the pot of boiling water.</li><li>While the linguine is cooking, use a vegetable peeler to peel the squash into long ribbons.</li><li>Once the linguine has cooked, drain it in a colander over the sink.</li><li>In the pot that was used to cook the linguine, add the drained linguine, pesto, and ribboned zucchini and toss until everything is evenly combined.</li><li>Serve and top with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano.</li></ol>'
